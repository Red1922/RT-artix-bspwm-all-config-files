# RT-artix-bspwm-all-config-files
All my .config files from my Artix Linux/BSPWM system.

- Picom is stock.
- Dunst is yet to be Riced.
- Credits to Endeavour OS/BSPWM Community Edition for some configuration. Their Github repo: https://github.com/EndeavourOS-Community-Editions/bspwm
- Some changes may still be done.
- Some lines are commented or their script files have not been uploaded. Please ignore those, I will configure them later.
